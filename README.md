# DynamicPrograming_WeightedInterval

The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each
instance, there will be a positive integer, giving the number of jobs. For each job, there will be a trio of
positive integers i, j and k, where i < j, and i is the start time, j is the end time, and k is the weight.

For each instance, your program should output the total weight of the intervals scheduled on a separate
line.
